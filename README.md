### Overview
The following analysis is done on the Seattle Airbnb dataset. To give a simple overview of what is going on here, I used the dataset to explore and find more information that should prove usefull to both hosts when they are trying to value their properties and things to keep in mind when doing so, guests when trying to book a listing from Airbnb. To be honest, this dataset is pretty rich with usefull data which could be used to answer pretty much any question that may come to one's mind when booking a vacation in Seattle specifically.
Here are some of the questions that came to my mind while exploring the data:
 1. What is the average price of Airbnb listings in Seattle?
 2. What are the most common types of property listed on Airbnb in Seattle (e.g., apartments, houses, etc.)?
 3. can we predict the price of a property based on the property features (Bedrooms, Bathrooms,...etc)?
