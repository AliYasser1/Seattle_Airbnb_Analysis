## Overview

The following analysis is done on the Seattle Airbnb dataset. To give a simple overview of what is going on here, I used the dataset to explore and find more information that should prove usefull to both hosts when they are trying to value their properties and things to keep in mind when doing so, guests when trying to book a listing from Airbnb. 

## Project-Motivation-

The Seattle Airbnb dataset is pretty rich with usefull data which could be used to answer pretty much any question that may come to one's mind when booking a vacation in Seattle specifically.
Here are some of the questions that came to my mind while exploring the data:
 1. What is the average price of Airbnb listings in Seattle?
 2. What are the most common types of property listed on Airbnb in Seattle (e.g., apartments, houses, etc.)?
 3. can we predict the price of a property based on the property features (Bedrooms, Bathrooms,...etc)?

By analyzing this dataset, I aim to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can help both hosts and guests make informed decisions.

## Files used

For this analysis I used two files. The first being an excel sheet that had all the data needed about the listings which I used to answer the first 2 question of the analysis. The second being another excel sheet that contained the dates and whether or not a listing is available for booking at each specific date.
